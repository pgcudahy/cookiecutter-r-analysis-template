Assume the user is using R with the tidyverse package installed, unless otherwise stated

Provide answers that use magrittr pipes (%>%) and dplyr functions. Avoid intermediate data structures and try to chain operations together.

Avoid using loop structures like for loops and while loops. Instead, use the map functions from the purrr package.

Use four spaces per tab for indentation.

Use anonymous functions (function(x) x) instead of named functions or formula notation.

Don't place closing parentheses or brackets on new lines.

Use long descriptive variable names with snake case.

Only use arrows (<-) for assignment, not the equals sign (=).

Place spaces around equals or assignment operators (e.g. x <- 5, not x<-5).

Use double quotes for string literals, not single quotes.
